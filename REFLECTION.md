## Reflection

1. Were your predictions right?
- My prediction for most screen time (Wednesday) was correct.
- Best focus day was Friday, also matched my prediction.
- More caffeine did not increase focus, which I expected might happen.

2. What surprised you?
- I was surprised that low caffeine days sometimes had higher focus levels.

3. What was tricky or rewarding?
- Tricky: figuring out how to loop through objects and calculate averages.
- Rewarding: seeing patterns emerge from my own data using code.

4. How did using your own data change things?
- Using real or realistic personal data made the analysis more meaningful and fun.
